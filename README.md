Tired of using shell commands to work with your remote device? Easily connect to a remote device (i.e. Raspberry Pi or Arduino) with SSH and modify files with a user interface.
## How to use
1. Enable SSH on your remote device.
2. Enter the root user and password, host (IP) address, port and directory you'd like to browse to connect to your remote machine.
3. Double click on a file to open its contents on your machine. Any time you save, the changes will automatically be updated to your remote device.

**Enjoy!**
