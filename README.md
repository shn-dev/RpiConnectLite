Easily connect and modify files on a remote device (i.e. Raspberry Pi, Arduino) via Windows, Mac, or Linux with SSH.

##How to use
1. Enter your remote device's root username and password, host (IP) address, port number, and the working directory you wish to view on the remote device. On a Raspberry Pi, the working directory might look like  "/home/pi/Documents."
2. **Right click** on any file and select "Direct edit" to open the file with your default program on your machine.
3. Any saved changes made to the file will automatically be sent to the remote device.

**Easy!**
